My name is Jeremy Liberman and I am currently 25 years old and work as a Software Developer in the Kansas City area.

I semi-recently graduated from college and I’ve been working professionally with the Microsoft stack of tools for two years.

The posts I pledge to make are going to draw inspiration from the computer technologies that I work with and the issues that arise when working with those technologies. I am ordinarily a private person and it may not always be easy for me to admit my mistakes, but I think that opening up my process for public scrutiny will help me stay thorough and honest. If others also benefit from this experiment then it is for all the better.

Right now, I’m working primarily with the Microsoft technologies (Visual Studio, C#, MVC 3, PowerShell), with some additional tools (NUnit, NHibernate, Rhino Mocks, Atlassian JIRA and Bamboo), and the occasional post about non-work side projects or special interests (XNA, Boo). I also want to explore software development methodologies and techniques (Agile, Test-Driven Development). I don’t know yet what this blog is going to become, but the goal is to create an environment for technical knowledge sharing and analysis that is equal parts fun, instructive, and experimental.

See you around.
